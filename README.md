Don't worry if you don't meet all requirements above :) 

### Before we start, install tensorflow first. 

```
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/
```
### Install Git
```
https://git-scm.com/downloads
```

### Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/jackg0h/devcon-ml
```
## Cd into the folder
```
cd devcon-ml
```

### Then install required libraries 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
````

### Change Keras backend to Tensorflow
```
https://keras.io/backend/
```

### Lets Get Started
Run following code in your terminal
```
jupyter notebook 
```

Workshop Objective:
- Sloving classification problem using supervise machine learning and deep learning algorithm 


A machine learning project may not be linear, but it has a number of well known steps:

1. Define Problem.
2. Prepare Data.
3. Evaluate Algorithms.
4. Improve Results.
5. Present Results.

Here is an overview of what we are going to cover:

-  Loading the dataset.
-  Summarizing the dataset.
-  Visualizing the dataset.
-  Evaluating some algorithms.
-  Making some predictions.


### Dataset used:

Machine Learning:

-  Tutorial: Iris dataset
-  Handson: Titanic dataset
 
Deep Learning (CNN): 
-  Tutorial:  MNIST (Handwritten dataset)
-  Tutorial:  Cat and Dog 
-  Handson :  Malaysian Foods
